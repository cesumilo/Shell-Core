# Shell-Core
This project is a part of another project called 42sh. It was made during my first year at Epitech. The goal was to develop a shell on Linux.

## What was our organisation ?
We thought about an modular architecture. The interest was to code a "Core" in order to manage several modules. Each person will be able to code his own module and make everything.
